Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! 🎉

One year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Please start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading data-flip="title"}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant to you:

* [Installation]{:.heading data-flip="title"} -- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Configuration]{:.heading data-flip="title"} Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
* [Migration]{:.heading data-flip="title"} -- You can skip this if you haven't used Hydejack before.

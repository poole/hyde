## The Basics of Blogging
**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

## An Impressive Portfolio
A portfolio that's guaranteed to be impressive — no matter what you put into it.

## A Printable Resume
Get a resume that's consistent across the board — whether it's on the web, mobile, print, or [PDF](assets/Resume.pdf).

## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a plain old *web page* at its core. It works without JavaScript, and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```js
document.getElementsByTagName("hy-push-state")[0].addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", function() {
  // <your init code>
});
```


## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][latex] it's also guaranteed to *look* beautiful.

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.

[^1]: You MAY open an issue on GitHub, but no response and/or fix is guaranteed.
      You understand that using Jekyll requires technical know-how and is not comparable to Wordpress in terms of ease of use. Please use the free version to confirm that Hydejack works for you. For details, see the [PRO] license.

When you are working on the command line, sooner or later you are going to want to edit a file through the terminal.
If you are working on a remote computer, you won't be able to use Word or some other graphical editor.

If you are new, the editor to use is called `nano`:

You start the editor like other commands, by writing `nano <your filename>`.

These commands are executed by pressing down the control key and typing the key indicated.
The commands are named, er, a little strangely, and so I've written what might be a more familiar name in parentheses:

    ^G Get Help
    ^X Exit (quit)

    ^O WriteOut (save)
    ^J Justify (wrap line)

    ^R Read File (open a file)
    ^W Where Is (search)

    ^Y Prev Page (move up)
    ^V Next Page (move down)

    ^K Cut Text (cut a whole line)
    ^U UnCut Text (paste)

    ^C Cur Pos (display where you are in the file)
    ^T To Spell (spell check)

How-To Geek has a nice [beginner's tutorial](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) on using `nano`.
If you outgrow `nano`, most folks end up using one of two very powerful editors: [vim](http://www.vim.org/) or [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
They are just fantastic.

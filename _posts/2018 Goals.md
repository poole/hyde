title: 2018 Goals
---

## Introduction
I graduated from Western Governor's University with a bachelor's degree in I.T. at the end of 2017. Now, the real work begins.

### Goals
- Get a job in web development
- Learn to touch type
- Read 26 books

### Implementation

#### Get a job in web development
Getting a degree was just the start. I'll be working through p1xt's [Get Job ready - JavaScript Edition - Version 2.0](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md). I've forked a copy of the guide to this repo to track my own progress. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/Always-Learning-2018/blob/master/Job-Ready-JavaScript-2.md)

#### Learn to touch type
I'll be using [The Typing Club](typingclub.com) to improve my typing skills. By the end of the year, I want to be touch typing at 60 WPM. [See my progress here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/Always-Learning-2018/blob/master/Typing-Club.md)

#### Read 26 Books
I'm using Tim Challie's [2018 Christian Reading Challenge](https://www.challies.com/resources/the-2018-christian-reading-challenge/). This is certainly the least technical of my educational goals, but choosing books that are mostly non-technical will keep me involved in a wide range of topics. [My progress is marked off here.](https://github.com/jakedecourcey/Always-Learning-2018/blob/master/2018-Christian-Reading-Challenge.md)

#### Learn Spanish
I'll be working through Duolingo's Spanish course along the way. This is a secondary goal, so progress won't be as blistering, but slow and steady will pay off in the end. Besides, the Mrs. is doing this one, too, so we can keep each other company. In Spanish. [Progress report here.]()

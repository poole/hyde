### Where to publish your work

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Codepen</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

Codepen is the easiest one to setup. You just need an account to begin with. Then create a new pen and copy paste your HTML code there.

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Github</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

This one takes time to setup. However, you can use the Github.com web based editor to upload or copy paste your HTML.

Then you need to go to the repository setting to enable the projects to be viewed on <your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>

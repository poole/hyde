# Week 2: Jan 14 - Jan 20

## Goal Progress

##### Job Ready JavaScript
Oof. I only finished one week's worth of CS50. I got stuck on a problem set for ages and just finished Sudnay night.

##### Typing
I stuck to my goals here and completed through lesson 43.

##### Reading
I also didn't read as much as I had hoped. I spent a little too much time playing a new computer game I discovered, *Battle for Wesnoth.* Still well on target, though. I'm nearly done with *A Brave New World.*

##### Spanish
I'm doing reasonably well in Spanish progess. It feels really slow because I'm reviewing stuff that's very familiar already.

## Noteworthy Notes
I've reached a point in typing where I need to use my pinkies, which is very diffcult for me. Also, I think I need a wrist rest.

Also, Duolingo has a Spanish podcast that I'll be checking out this week.


## Looking Ahead
This week, I intend to complete through week 7 in CS50. This is the same goal as last week; I'm leaving room for getting stuck again.

I'm still going to type 20 lessons this week, but I'm not going ot hold myself to at least one a day. Days off are good.

Same for Spanish. No daily goal, but I want to finish 5 lessons.

I'm also going to finish *A Brave New World* by Tuesday so that I can start on something else.

### Current curriculum

#### Data for Data Science

Researchers face a growing data management challenge, starting with data collection and continuing through data analysis, publication, and archival. Potential problems research labs may face include scalability of their data management methods to many and/or very large data files, fully documenting data and its organization, and meeting requirements of grants/publication related to data sharing. This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to best practices in data organization and management. Each one-hour lecture will include lecture, discussion, and practice exercises. This course assumes no prior training in data science. At the end of this course, you will be able to identify resources at Fred Hutch for data management and apply best practices in data organization to your own research projects. 
* Week 1: Data entry and creating spreadsheets
* Week 2: Organizing data and project files
* Week 3: Documenting data with metadata
* Week 4: Data manipulation and reproducibility


#### Introduction to R

This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to R statistical programming and its broad applications. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have no prior computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use R to import, manipulate, and visualize data. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/R_intro).
* Week 1: R syntax, assigning objects, using functions
* Week 2: Data types and structures; slicing and subsetting data
* Week 3: Data manipulation with dplyr
* Week 4: Data visualization in ggplot2


#### Introduction to Python

This four-week course is designed to introduce attendees to Python programming and its broad applications. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes attendees have no prior computer coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to use Python to import, manipulate, and visualize data. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/python_intro).
* Week 1: Intro to python, jupyter notebooks, and data types
* Week 2: Using pandas to explore data frames
* Week 3: Extracting data from data frames
* Week 4: Data visualization with ggplot

#### Intermediate Python: Programming

This four-week course focuses on task automation using Python programming. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises, and assumes participants are familiar with all material in Introduction to Python (basic syntax including variables and functions, importing data, data types and structures, subsetting data). At the end of this course, you will be able to create fully documented and automated workflows to perform data analysis tasks. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/python_programming).
* Week 1: Review of pre-requisites, repeating actions with loops
* Week 2: Analyzing data from multiple files, conditional statements, creating functions
* Week 3: Errors and exceptions, defensive programming
* Week 4: Debugging, modules/packaging for reproducibility

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub

This two-week course (with optional third week session) is designed to introduce attendees to git version control software and GitHub as a repository for code and/or data. Each two hour session will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises. The first two sessions assume no prior programming knowledge. At the end of these two sessions, you will be able to use git to track changes to software and other files, and use GitHub to work collaboratively to publish repositories of code and/or data. The optional third session assumes attendees have a basic familiarity with using the command line to navigate through directories and work with files and will include an overview of the command line interface to access the full functionality of the git software. Course materials [here](https://github.com/fredhutchio/git_github_intro).
* Week 1: introduction to version control, git workflow with desktop clients (tracking changes, branching, merging, ignoring things)
* Week 2: Collaboration and code sharing with GitHub, resolving conflicts
* Week 3 (optional): git workflow on the command line

#### Concepts in Machine Learning

This four week course is designed to introduce attendees to central concepts in machine learning as well as examples of applications in biomedical research. Each one hour lecture will emphasize conceptual and practical aspects of machine learning paradigms, explore the foundations of underlying mechanisms, and look at current or potential applications through examples or case studies. The course assumes a strong foundation in basic statistics, but does not assume any prior coding experience. At the end of this course, you will be able to understand the core differences between different forms of machine learning and consider their application with respect to a variety of problem spaces. This course (or equivalent knowledge/preparation) is intended as a prerequisite for future courses covering machine learning skills in both R and Python.
* Week 1: Introduction and Conceptual Overview; Machine Learning and Experimental Design
* Week 2: Case Study in Classification
* Week 3: Case Study in Regression
* Week 4: Case Study in Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

#### Software Carpentry Bootcamp: Unix, Git, and Python

This bootcamp-style course is designed to introduce attendees to a collection of tools useful for reproducible computational research: Unix (bash) shell scripting, version control with Git, and programming with Python. The class will meet over four consecutive days for three hours each session. Each class meeting will include brief tutorials interspersed with challenge exercises. No prior programming experience is required. Course materials [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
* Day 1: Task automation with Unix (bash) shell scripting
* Day 2: Version control with Git
* Day 3: Programming with Python: data structures, loops, conditionals
* Day 4: Programming with Python: creating functions, errors and exceptions, defensive programming

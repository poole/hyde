When you need to share your code with others, you can use these two code sharing website.

## 4. Publishing Website online
To take your website from your own computer and share it with the world, you need to publish it on a web server. A web host provides a web server, where you can publish you website.

You can use the following web hosts to publish your website online.
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/devpractical): convenient for Wordpress website but can work for any other website.

## 5. Buy domain name:
You can buy your domain name from any seller. I use [Bitsimba](https://bitsimba.com/clients/aff.php?aff=22) to buy my domains. I use them because I can pay using Mpesa wallet.
You can also host a Wordpress or HTML website with them and get SSL without additional cost.

Remember, any host can sell you a domain name and then you can point it to your prefered host.

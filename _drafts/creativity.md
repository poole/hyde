# Creativity

Creativity is a difficult thing to describe. There are no pre-requisites to having it. It's not limited to a certain group of people or particular career type. It **is** a form of expression. However, in the 'creative' industries, it has become somewhat of a commodity.

Sometimes it can feel like if you don't fit into a certain mould/box with a particular skill set, and if you've not had your full focus on one area (e.g. graphic design or web development), you're not worth considering. There is no room for multi-tasking at certain creative tables. However, everyone must have more than one thing in their life that they're good at. If that bleeds into their career, then what's the harm in that? Surely if you can provide a company with a wide variety of skills, then you're more valuable than not?  

Part of the problem seems to be that if you're capable of doing more than one role, it's assumed you won't have focused enough on that main aspect of your career to be strong as someone who has. My counter argument to that would be...

The other thing that I find stands in a lot of people's way is when they haven't got a topic-specific qualification that a role asks for. This is particularly true of graphic design. Many people I know that studied GD at university have said that they found the degree inadequately prepared them for the working world of design. That's not to say that all graphic design degree courses are inherently bad or not going to teach you all you need to know, but most of your learning in this area comes through practise and experimenting - much like learning to code (more on that in another post). Until you start playing around with colours/software/ideas, gaining knowledge and stronger skills, there is only so much that a person standing at the front of a class can teach you. A few friends of mine never went to university, and despite this, have been very successful in their chosen creative fields. 

All of these things could potentially become stumbling blocks to your creativity. It's hard to stay motivated if you're persistantly being told you don't fit the bill and that you're just not as good as the other person. However, you don't have growth without adversity.

Let's go forward working with the mindset that there is no box. You can be whomever you want to be and do whatever you want to do, regardless of your qualications. If you love both knitting and sky-diving, then do both; if you want to be a CEO and a circus clown because you enjoy it, that's fine. 

These are obviously very random and extreme examples, but it's no different to being multi-disciplined in your career. Many people have employable skills that they don't even realise are relevent because they're not 'required' under their job description.

I want to be creative in every aspect of my life, be it my work; doing [Parkour](https://youtu.be/2Iapa03dfLU) - my favourite form of exercise and physical creative expression; or even something as simple as writing a list (again, I'll do a seperate post on this shortly). If it's not colourful, written well or thoughtfully considered as to how it can inspire others, then why bother? I want everything I do to be full of passion and a desire to express who I am and what I stand for. I hope that that comes across in my actions. Hopefully, it might eventually speak to someone looking to fill my dream role.

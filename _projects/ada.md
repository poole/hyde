Developing software systems isn't the only way to help empower world citizens. Written fictionally from the perspective of Ada Lovelace, the famous female computer scientists, this partially illustrated story will try to make programmatic thinking accessible to children and youth. The goal is to mix computer science ideas and good morals into a children's book, a lot like the ones a lot of us grew up with.

Ada is on her way, hopefully by the holiday season. An update to this post with a teaser and release date is coming soon!

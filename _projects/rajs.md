A side project to create a relational algebra syntax and runtime to use in web applications to help teach a relational database class. Instead of using relational algebra to SQL transpilation, this uses pure JavaScript and the affinityjs package, ready for the web and mobile apps.

See [here for Ra.js repo](https://github.com/adellahlou/ra-js) and run some relational algebra. See also [Ra-parser I also wrote](https://github.com/adellahlou/ra-parser) to define the syntax.

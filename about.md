## Hydejack
Hydejack is a cutting-edge Jekyll theme that combines the best of static sites and modern web apps. It features a suite of JavaScript that makes the page feel like an app, without sacrificing backwards-compatibility, page-load speed or SEO.

**Hydejack** aims to be the complete package for professionals on the web.
It features a blog suitable for both prose and technical documentation,

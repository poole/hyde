fredhutch.io is an initiative to facilitate education about and promote access to computational resources at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

We

* Maintain the Fred Hutch Galaxy instance, adding tools as needed
* Offer training and consulting for researchers using Galaxy in their work
* Offer a seven-week bioinformatics training course for beginners
* Organize ad-hoc [events](/events/index.html) around computational topics

The initiative was started by [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org/) and [Brian Claywell](https://github.com/bcclaywell) and funded through and reviewed by the Public Health Sciences division.

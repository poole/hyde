DevPractical is a website that focuses on helping beginners to learn, create and publish web based projects.

It mainly focuses on beginners, and anyone who want to create something useful but is not ready to learn lots of languages while starting out.

It is my hope that this website will explain things with the beginners mindset and you will find it useful.

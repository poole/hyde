 Device used as the bottom of the honeybee hive.  The bottom board provides the support to the hive and the entrance to the hive.  The screened bottom board has the supports on the sides but the middle is all a screen.  It is a tool used in an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan to help control the varoa mite.

 As a part of the IPM plan, the screen is there to allow any varroa mites that fall from the bees to fall on the ground where they can not return to the hive.  A sticky board can be inserted under the screen so that falling mites can be counted prior to treatment and during the first few day after a treatment.

 It allows air flow up into the hive while preventing other insects and pests from entering the hive.  In the summer it aides the bees in cooling the hive.  In the winter a corigated board is usually inserted to block the cold and wind.
